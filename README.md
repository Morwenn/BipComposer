BipComposer
===========

**WARNING**: *this project was an attempt at a reboot of an old GameMaker project and was never anywhere near working.*

BipComposer is a useless tool to compose simple music pieces and play them with
the PC speaker. Originally written for Game Maker, this new version runs with
Python 3, PySide and PySFML.

Compatibility
-------------

Currently only works well with Windows, should work with super user privileges under
Linux. Will not work with OS X.
